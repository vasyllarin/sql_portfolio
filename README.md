## SQL portfolio

#### Project 1. Data exploration. Covid dataset
###### Original data was obtained from the ourworldindata website: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus.
###### The dataset was downloaded on 17 October 2023, so SQL exploration was performed on the data that was available at that time.
###### For the portfolio purposes, the original dataset was split into two tables: covid_deaths and covid_vaccinations. Both files (covid_deaths and covid_vaccinations) are available at the link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M5xB6QYZYun_4rd9D1vZ9cyX5QFqAyJf?usp=sharing.
###### File with SQL queries is presented in this repository and available at the link: https://github.com/vasyllarin/sql_portfolio/blob/main/project_1_data_exploration_covid_dataset.sql.
